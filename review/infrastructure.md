# ðŸŒ± Infrastructure

{% hint style="info" %}
Now, basically, the components of the **BLAGO** network are ready-made solutions from various companies and individual development teams.
{% endhint %}

## Blockchain

> For tasks of the **BLAGO** network related to financial transactions, the **TON (The Open Network)** blockchain is used, as it seems to be the fastest and most scalable among others. Another plus is the joint integration with the Telegram messenger, which improves and simplifies network development.&#x20;

> _The choice of blockchain and other network components may change depending on the needs of the community and the problems that need to be solved._

At the moment, a simple smart contract with the **xBLAGO** token has been created in the TON blockchain, through the minter application.

_<mark style="color:red;">This is a test smart contract; in the future, another one with expanded functionality will be created.

Some needs have also been created and assets have been digitized, which can be viewed at the following address [tonscan](https://tonscan.org/address/EQA9fcLk-yoJ8SeY9FRoRS4coZZwbWcCCtpQWSC9i\_8zGz\_J#nfts).

## Control

The functionality of the **BLAGO** network is controlled through a telegram bot [xBLAGObot](https://xblagobot.t.me). In it you can create needs to digitize assets, manage finances, participate in voting and get support.

## Network scanner

Actions to track all operations are tracked through a web application inside the telegram bot [xBLAGObot](https://xblagobot.t.me) or on the [site](https://blago.pages.dev) scanner **BLAGO**. Here, transactions of all users are broadcast, which are grouped and summarized into statistical data.
