## Introduction

The development of technology has made it possible to erase state borders, uniting humanity into a new community. The developed financial model removes the division between rich and poor, increasing people's living standards. All resources and achievements of humanity now belong to everyone equally.&#x20;

... but for this I had to change my thinking and believe that this is better for everyone. And perhaps this is the only way to stop wars and other conflicts.

> As in a friendly family, we all strive to live in a prosperous environment, developing in ourselves such qualities as love, kindness, sincerity, honesty, and so on. Everyone puts themselves on an equal footing with all members of our society.&#x20;
